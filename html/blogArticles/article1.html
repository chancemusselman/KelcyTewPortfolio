            <p><span style="font-size: 3rem; line-height: 0em;">H</span>ave you ever loved something so much that you
                just couldn’t
                afford? Of course you have, unless perhaps
                you’re Jeff Bezos. This was my predicament when I discovered the lovely shop Young in the Mountains,
                which sells handmade jewlery. I was immediately drawn to their Cerclen ring, which featured gorgeous
                inlay gemstones with a diamond center. I had to have it until I saw the price: $910. As much as I would
                love to support their business, I could not afford to buy a ring that cost almost as much as I make in a
                week. Sadly, I set aside my wishes to own one of these rings. Maybe one day.
                <br><br>
                One day, after creating my Terrazo Clay earrings (link here) I decided to create some marbled clay stud
                earrings, but even with the banded colors they looked exceptionally, plain. Then I remembered, I had a
                plastic rhinestone bangle that I hadn’t worn since the mid-2000s, when I went through a (regrettable)
                rhinestone phase. Did anyone else experience that as well? Rhinestone trucker hats, rhinestone flip
                flops, rhinestone t-shirts...yikes.
                <br><br>
                I bagged up my rhinestone bracelet in a Ziploc and repeatedly smacked it on a countertop, releasing the
                beautiful little rhinestones from the gaudy plastic bangle. These kind of looked like diamonds and the
                beautiful Cerclen ring again was at the forefront of my mind.
                <br><br>
                I pressed the rhinestone into the center of my marbled clay earrings and put them in the oven to bake,
                hoping nothing catastrophic would happen.
                <br><br>
                After 15 minutes in the oven, I had beautiful marble clay stud earrings with a rhinestone center. I was
                initially elated, until I discovered I could only appreciate my creation while looking in the mirror.
                Damn.
                <br><br>
                Although learning to metalsmith has long been on my to-do list, I was far too impatient to begin that
                endeavor for this specific project and hit up Etsy for an empty bezel cup ring. I found what I was
                looking for from a shop called BeachBumSupplies. I purchased two of their Stainless Steel bezel cup
                rings, which was their cheapest option, for $19.95 each.
                <br><br>
                Once they arrived, I again marbeled clay, this time trying to mimic Malachite, which features beautfil
                bands of green.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                I used the bezel cup as a cookie cutter to ensure I had the size clay I needed to fill the bezel cup.
                The clay stuck inside my bezel cup, but instead of trying to remove the clay, I pressed a rhinestone
                into the center, and placed the entire ring in the oven to bake, again, hoping for the best.
                <br>
                My ring emerged from the oven in perfect condition and I had achieved a look similar to the ring I
                wanted so badly but couldn’t afford. Instead of $910 my ring cost me less than $25 and I love it.
